# MIPS palindrome checker
MIPS Palindrome Checker learning project

This is just a short script written in MIPS assembler to check for palindromes in an ASCII string.
It ignores everything that is not a character of A-Z and upper/lowercase
 Can be run via MIPS32 emulator [Mars](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/)
